     <p>This study will help the current research because we will be looking at the students’ experiences specifically. Most of the existent literature focuses on what the NCAA is doing wrong but does  not focus on the students. Interviews serve as a valuable way to find out how students get through their day as athletes and students without getting paid. By doing this we can get a better understanding of the issue from those who deal with it on a daily basis and those who see it from within the school, but without participating. If applying for funding, this research can play a key role in the success of student athletes by making a push towards providing them with more financial support. Many of these athletes can make a career out of basketball, but without the proper support they can’t put their full efforts into school and sport.</p>

     <p>I hope to build on current literature by showing what people think of this in a more general sense. My questions will be centered 
        around this idea as well. One question I want to pursue is what students feel is the proper compensation for student athletes.</p>-->
