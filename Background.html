    <h1>Background</h1>

      <p>Current research shows the update that allows students to make money off of their own image through endorsements and merchandise
        that they sell, however students still can not make money from the profits schools make off of ticket sales.</p><br />
      <p>There is some extant research that covers some of the research I hope to pursue, however, we are not always able to see studentsâ€™
         opinions on this matter, including outside views from students who might not play the sport that is mentioned, or might not play sports at all.
         One article that does provide this is (Allison et al., 2022). This article looks at public opinions about paying college athletes but in a more
         racial relation. I hope to build on current literature by showing what people think of this in a more general sense. My questions will be centered 
         around this idea as well. One question I want to pursue is what students feel is the proper compensation for student athletes</p>
