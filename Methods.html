    <p>Method Type: Interviews</p>

    <h2> Methods</h2>
    <p> In order to test my hypothesis, I plan on making use of qualitative data in the form of interviews. This method will be useful because it will allow individuals who have actual insight about paying athletes to share their view. In testing this method I would find students from 5 different d1 basketball programs. I would interview 4 students from each school, 2 who are athletes and 2 who are not. The reasoning for this is because student athletes will likely have a different perspective than those who attend the school but do not play for the team. Some factors would be because of convenience, so likely English-speaking students, and students who are familiar with their school’s basketball program. It would be required for them to have attended at least 3 games within their time at the school. The athletes would include one from the starting lineup and one individual who comes off the bench.  I would exclude students from d2 and d3 basketball programs, because of the lack of scholarships for students. The more competitive d1 programs offer scholarships and lots of tools to succeed in certain ways, but also takes away players’ ability to make money on their own. These school’s also bring in more money from ticket sales, so it seems even more unfair for athletes to not be supported with some of these funds. </p>
    <h2> Design </h2>
    <p> I will vary the school’s in which I complete the interviews in order to get some variance in perspective based on what the school might offer. This brings less bias into the answers and provides a more accurate answer to the hypothesis. The hypothesis could be disconfirmed if the majority of participants disagree with the sentiment that college athletes aren’t treated fairly in regards to financial support. The same is true for confirming the hypothesis. Having a majority of students who agree with this idea could help prove the hypothesis. I will develop a set of questions that will be asked to the group of student athletes, and a separate set of questions for non-athletes. The students in the athlete group will all be asked the same set of questions, while the non-athletes will be asked a different set of questions, however, it will be the same throughout their group. This will be the control factor that will remain the same for each group. The types of effects that would be likely to occur which would make my results appear to confirm their hypothesis could be large disagreement in the answers regarding the fairness of the NCAA not paying players. </p>
    <h2> Procedure </h2>
    <p> I will present stimuli through interview questions which will get varied responses that will either prove or disprove the hypothesis. The participants will answer the questions, providing answers based on their experiences. I plan on beginning by asking participants permission to partake in the interview, and then building rapport with the participants with my initial questions. Each interview will be a maximum of 30 minutes.</p>
    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p> I will analyze the results by looking at which way the answers lean. I will ask myself whether or not the students think it is unfair or fair to not pay players. If the interview clearly hints that a student thinks it is fair for players to not be paid, that will go against my hypothesis. If a student thinks it is unfair, my hypothesis will be confirmed.</p>
    <p>  2) What needs are covered through scholarship?</p>
    <p>  3) What do students (non-athletes) believe is fair for student athletes to be paid?</p>
    <p>  4) What do athletes believe is fair for them to be paid?</p>
    <p>  5) Are the new updates to compensation fair for all players, or do they just benefit popular ones?</p>

    <p> Hypothesis: Student athletes believe it is unfair for the NCAA to be making the money they do without giving some of the profits to students who play on the teams.</p>
    <p> If Confirmed: If my hypothesis is correct it will show that many of these students are not able to be as successful as they could be because they are worried about supporting themselves, while also dedicating vast amounts of time to developing their skills. This is especially true for students who are not on scholarship or are not getting all of their school paid for. </p>
    <p> If Disconfirmed: If my hypothesis is disconfirmed, it will show that students don’t believe that getting paid is necessary and can bring insight about how college athletes find success in school and sport. </p>

     <p>I hope to build on current literature by showing what people think of this in a more general sense. My questions will be centered 
        around this idea as well. One question I want to pursue is what students feel is the proper compensation for student athletes.</p>-->
