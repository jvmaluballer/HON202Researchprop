      <p>I plan on studying the effects of students not getting paid to play college sports through the NCAA. This issue is critical because it highlights
      the NCAAâ€™s unwillingness to pay athletes who are bringing in much of their profits. Without the players it's obvious that there would be no ticket sales
      which is how they make their money. Paying students fare wages simply makes sense so that they can more easily balance their lives with school and sports.
      Players who might be struggling behind the scenes with dedicating time to basketball and also finding means to make money could benefit greatly from getting paid
      by the organization. The NCAA should no longer be able to sit by and rake in billions of dollars while the players who bring in this kind of money are struggling.</p><br><br>
